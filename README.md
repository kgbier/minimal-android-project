# Minimal Android Project

### Konrad Biernacki (kgbier@gmail.com)

Initialising a working Android application step-by-step, without a pre-existing sample or scaffold.

To see what the end-result is, simply run `./gradlew installDebug`. Android studio is not required.

Explore the `main` branch to see how a working Android application takes shape, one commit at a time.

To follow along from the beginning, all you need to start is to have `gradle` installed. If you do not want to install `gradle` yourself, you can instead checkout _Step 1: Init gradle_, which will provide a local distribution for the project via `./gradlew`.

At each stage, feel free to explore what is happening by:
- Opening the project in Android Studio
- Running `./gradlew tasks`
- Running `./gradlew assembleDebug`
